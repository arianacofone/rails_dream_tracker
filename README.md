Dreams are weird. I think we all can get on that train. But why do we always forget them within two minutes of waking up? To help decode your crazy subconscious, I created a rails app that allows you to enter your dream and give it a fancy title. Welcome to the future of dream decoding.</br>

## Built With
* Rails
* Ruby

## Why Rails?
Here are my top 3 reasons:</br>
1. Set up in lightening quick. Within 30 secs your file structure is done.</br>
2. Schema: It gives you an birds eye view of your database structure in one file.</br>
3. HTML rendering is seamlessly tied into the API aspect of Rails.</br>

## Set Up
git clone git@github.com:arianadziedzic/rails_dream_tracker.git</br>
cd dream_app</br>
bin/setup</br>

## Run Locally
rails s
Visit localhost:3000 to view the dream tracker!
